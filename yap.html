    <h1>My love for Cars</h1>
    <p>One huge thing about me is that I like cars.
        Like old Volvos, trucks, sports cars. 
        I love the rumble that big engines make. 
        I like more of the mean sounding ones which is typically from American V8’s. 
        Italian V12 are ok but doesn’t sound quite as mean.
        It’s also something about the fact that a man-made object can be capable of such great speeds. 
        And reach those speeds in a matter of seconds. 
        Driving also is relaxing I find. Sadly, nowadays being an car enthusiast is harder and harder 
        with gas prices, car prices, and more electric cars being implemented.</p>
